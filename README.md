OBJECTIVE

Our objective is to create a system that used for detecting whether a disease is present or not, and then classifying the type of disease, if present. Detecting the disease. Categorized the disease.

RESULTS

In this section, we will discuss the results achieved by the experimental studies of the proposed multiclass model. Roughly after 10 epochs, The model achieved a 88.72%. accuracy in validation phase while nearly 90% accuracy is obtained in the training phase, which is quite encouraging. In CNN final training accuracy is 85.85% and final validation accuracy is 73.68%, F1-score value is 0.2392, precision value is 0.3661 and value for class 0 is 0.1, for class 1 is 0.5, for class 2 is 0.375, for class 3 is 0.166. in VGG 16 test accuracy 88.72%, F1-score value is 0.3700, precision for class 0 is 0.16, for class 1 is 0.29, for class 2 Is 0.52, for class 3 is 0.02 and recall value is 0.24.
